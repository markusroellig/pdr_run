    Issue #10: Race condition in parallel uploads

    OLD IMPLEMENTATION (racy):
    1. rclone copy local.txt remote:/dir/
       → Creates remote:/dir/local.txt
    2. rclone moveto remote:/dir/local.txt remote:/dir/target.txt
       → Renames to target name

    Problem: Between steps 1 and 2, another worker can:
    - Overwrite the same file
    - Move it before this worker gets to step 2
    - Cause "object not found" or "size mismatch" errors

    NEW IMPLEMENTATION (atomic):
    1. rclone copyto local.txt remote:/dir/target.txt
       → Directly copies to target name in one operation

    Benefits:
    - Single atomic operation
    - No intermediate state
    - Safe for parallel execution
    - No race conditions
